Designed and tested on macOS. Not fully tested, but should work for Windows/Linux. But this theme does not include styles for Windows “unibody” style.

## How to use

0. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/runkaiz/seattle-theme/releases).
1. Open Typora, find `Preferences`, then go to `Apperance`, and click `Open Theme Folder`.
2. Drag `seattle` folder and `seattle.css` into the opened folder.
3. If you want inline LaTeX like the example file, make sure to check Inline Math within settings under the Markdown tab.
4. Quit Typora completely, then reopen it and find `Theme` from the menu bar, and select `Seattle`.

## Credits

Shout out to the original [Merced](https://github.com/yych42/merced-theme) theme which inspired me to design my own. The undergraduate years are more often than not one of the most impactful time in someone's life, and so we named our themes after where those experiences took place.
